# author says its common- even standard- to accept stream from file and STDIN
echo "hello from standard input" | cat
# => hello from standard input

# but when I tried `cat "hello"`, I got "cat: hello: No such file or directory"
# when I knew that echo was piping no file or directory to `cat`, hence this
# excerpt from `man cat`
"If file is a single dash (`-') or absent, cat reads from the standard input."
